        8 Mile is a 2002 American drama film written by Scott Silver and directed by Curtis Hanson. It stars Eminem in
        his film
        debut, alongside Mekhi Phifer, Brittany Murphy, Michael Shannon, Anthony Mackie, and Kim Basinger. The film,
        which
        contains autobiographical elements from Eminem's life, follows white rapper Jimmy Smith Jr. aka B-Rabbit
        (Eminem) and
        his attempt to launch a career in hip hop, a music genre dominated by African Americans. The title is derived
        from 8
        Mile Road, the highway between the predominantly African American city of Detroit and the largely white suburban
        communities to the north that Eminem originally lived in.
